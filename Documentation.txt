A Linux-based operating system (such as Ubuntu or Debian)
Java 8 or Java 11 installed on your machine
Sudo privileges or root access to install packages


Installation

1. First, update the package list by running the command:

Here's a brief guide on how to run Jenkins using the WAR file:-

1. Download the latest version of the Jenkins WAR file from the official website: https://www.jenkins.io/download/
2. Place the downloaded WAR file in a convenient location on your Linux machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the WAR file is located.
4. Run the following command to start Jenkins:
java -jar jenkins.war
Replace "jenkins.war" with the name of the actual WAR file if it is different.


Jenkins will start up and display some logs in the terminal. Wait for the message "Jenkins is fully up and running" to appear.
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the Jenkins web interface.
Follow the prompts to complete the Jenkins setup process.
Note: By default, Jenkins will run on port 8080. If you need to change the port, add the following option to the command when starting Jenkins: --httpPort=<port_number>



By default it will set a password for me, will be available on terminal -
